### 🛠 Exercise 3: Cache Dependencies for Faster Builds

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/03-cache-dependencies.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Cache dependencies to speed up workflow execution.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow file (based on `02-run-tests.yaml`) that:
    - Caches dependencies to avoid reinstalling them on every run.
    - Restores the cache if available, otherwise installs dependencies as usual.
2. Commit & push the workflow.
3. Observe the caching mechanism in the GitHub Actions logs.

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/04-upload-reports.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Store test results (screenshots, logs) as GitHub Actions artifacts.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow file (based on `03-cache-dependencies.yaml`), that uploads the following folders:
    - For TypeScript: `playwright-report` and `test-results`
    - For Java: `target/reports` and `target/surefire-reports`
2. Commit & push changes.
   3Run the tests and check artifacts in GitHub Actions UI.

🔗 Relevant Documentation:

### 📌 Exercise 5: Show Test Report in GitHub UI

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/05-show-report.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Display test results directly in the GitHub Actions summary tab.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow file (based on `03-cache-dependencies.yaml`), that displays the HTML test report using an action such as `phoenix-actions/test-reporting@v15` or a similar alternative.
    - For Java: Use the report file `target/reports/surefire.html`
    - For TypeScript: Use the report file `playwright-report/index.html`
2. Commit & push changes.
3. Observe the test report preview in the GitHub Actions summary tab.

### 🔗 Exercise 6: Run Tests on Pull Requests

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/06-run-on-pr.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Automatically test pull requests.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow file (based on `03-cache-dependencies.yaml`)
2. Modify the workflow’s `on:` field to trigger tests on pull requests.
3. Create a new branch, modify a test, and open a pull request.
4. Observe the test execution in GitHub Actions.

🔗 Relevant Documentation:
- [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)

---

### 📌 Exercise 7: Fail PRs if Tests Fail

💡 Goal: Prevent merging if tests fail.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Ensure your workflow is set up to run tests on pull requests (e.g., using your existing `.github/workflows/05-run-on-pr.yaml` file).
2. In GitHub, enable "Require status checks to pass before merging" (classic protection rule) for your branch.
3. Test the setup by pushing a commit that intentionally fails a test.

- ❗Note: This setup only works if you have a paid GitHub plan.
- 💡Note: For organizations on GitHub Team/Enterprise, you can also use [branch rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

### 🔧 Exercise 8: Create a Custom GitHub Action

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/08-custom-action.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Create and use a custom GitHub Action.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Edit your workflow to simulate Playwright test output and use the custom action to process it.
   <details>
   <summary>See hints</summary>

   Create a directory `test-results` and generates a test report file `report.txt` inside it.  
   Write fake test results to the file, simulating passed and failed tests.

   </details>
2. Inside `.github/actions/`, create a folder `playwright-summary`.
3. Inside the folder, create `action.yaml` and define a composite action that processes Playwright test results.
   <details>
   <summary>See hints</summary>

   The custom action processes the `test-results/report.txt` file, extracts its content, and formats a summary for display in GitHub job summaries.

   </details>
4. Commit & push your changes.
5. Observe the formatted test summary in the GitHub Actions logs.

✨ Note: Feel free to come up with an own idea and implement it as custom action.

### ⏰ Exercise 9: Scheduled Regression Suites

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/09-scheduled-regression.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Set up a workflow that automatically runs on a weekday schedule.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a new workflow file  `09-scheduled-regression.yaml` (based on any of the already existing workflows)
2. Modify the workflow to trigger automatically on a schedule (weekdays at 1 AM UTC).
3. Commit & push your changes.
4. Observe test execution in GitHub Actions logs once the scheduled time passes.

❗ Note: To really observe the execution, set the trigger to execute shortly after you will have pushed.

🔗 Relevant Documentation:
- [GitHub Actions schedule event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)
- [CRON syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule)

### 🐳 Exercise 10: Containerized Testing with Docker
📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/10-containerized-testing.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Run tests inside Docker containers to ensure consistency across different environments.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow `10-containerized-testing.yaml` file (based on `03-cache-dependencies.yaml`) that:
    - Uses Docker containers to run tests.
    - Runs on every push and pull request.
2. Modify your test setup to execute inside a Docker container.
    - For Java: Use a `maven:latest` container to run tests.
    - For TypeScript: Use a `node:latest` container with Playwright pre-installed.
3. Ensure dependencies are installed inside the container.
4. Commit & push your changes.
5. Observe the test execution logs inside the container.

### ⚡ Exercise 11: Parallel Test Execution

📂 Workflow file: `.github/workflows/11-parallel-tests.yaml`  
💡 Goal: Configure a matrix strategy in GitHub Actions to run Playwright tests concurrently across different browsers or environments.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a new workflow file `11-parallel-tests.yaml` (based on `03-cache-dependencies.yaml`).
2. Use a matrix strategy to define multiple browsers (e.g., `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`)
    - For Java: pass a system property (e.g. `-Dplaywright.browserName=${{ matrix.browser }}`).
    - For TypeScript: pass the browser name to `npx playwright test` (e.g. `--browser ${{ matrix.browser }}`).
3. Java only: Update your project files so tests can pick the correct browser:
    - Open `src/test/java/dev/christianbaumann/PlaywrightTest.java`
    - Uncomment the second @BeforeAll method and comment out the default one
4. Commit & push the new workflow (and any modified files).
5. Observe the concurrent runs in GitHub Actions. Each job in the matrix should execute in parallel, one for each browser/ environment.

💡 Goal: Execute tests in parallel across all combinations of Ubuntu, Windows, Mac with Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit.

#### 📌 Instructions

1. Create a workflow (based on `11-parallel-tests.yaml`) file that:
    - Runs tests in parallel across Ubuntu, Windows, and Mac.
    - Tests each browser: Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit.
    - Uses a matrix strategy to cover all combinations.
2. Java: Keep the changes in `src/test/java/dev/christianbaumann/PlaywrightTest.java` from [Exercise 11](#exercise-11-parallel-test-execution)
3. Commit & push the workflow.
4. Observe the test execution across different platforms and browsers.
